# Mongo Crud operations

###Basic operations

to interact with mongoDB API you need to always use the `DB` Object, followed by the `CollectionName`, followed by the action to execute.

In the following example I just want to get all the documents from a collection called `contacts`. The way you do it is using the method `find` from the collection.

```sh
db.contacts.find()
```
*The example above retrieve all the documents from the contacts collection in packages of 20 documents per call*

#### The find method
As mentioned in the previous example, the find methods get all the fields from the collection. To extend or modify your search criterias the find method take arguments as Json.

```sh
db.contacts.find({ name : "Leo Javier" });
```
*The example above retrieve only the documents that contains a propery called `name` with `Leo Javier` as a value. This is the `WHERE` version of MongoDB*
