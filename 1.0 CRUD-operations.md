# Mongo Crud operations

###Basic operations

to interact with mongoDB API you need to always use the `DB` Object, followed by the `CollectionName`, followed by the action to execute.

In the following example I just want to get all the documents from a collection called `contacts`. The way you do it is using the method `find` from the collection.

```sh
db.contacts.find()
```
*The example above retrieve all the documents from the contacts collection in packages of 20 documents per call*

#### The find method
As mentioned in the previous example, the find methods get all the fields from the collection. To extend or modify your search criterias the find method take arguments as Json.

```sh
db.contacts.find({ name : "Leo Javier" });
```
*The example above retrieve only the documents that contains a propery called `name` with `Leo Javier` as a value. This is the `WHERE` version of MongoDB*



#### UPDATE

```sh
// This is a dangerous operation
db.contacts.update({ name : "Leo Javier" }, { age : 30 });
```
*IMPORTANT: The example above will change all the fields in the document. if this document happend to have another field, it would be removed from the document.*

#### $set operator
The set operator only affect the field specified from the document, and if the field doesn't exist it will create the new field and assing the new value (in this case 30).
```sh
// This is a safe
db.contacts.update({ name : "Leo Javier" }, { age : { $set : 30 } });
```
*This is a more reliable operation. It will only modify the property specified with the `$set` operator*

#### $inc operator
This operator increment the current value of a field by the value specified. If the field doesn't exist, it would create a new field with the value specified
```sh
// This is a safe
db.contacts.update({ name : "Leo Javier" }, { $inc : { age : 1 } });
```
*This is a more reliable operation. It will only modify the property specified with the `$set` operator*

#### $unset operator
This operator is often used to change the current schema of a document in a collection

```sh
// remove the field "age" ant its value from the document
db.contacts.update({ name : "Leo Javier" }, { $unset { age : 30 }});
```
